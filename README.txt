Markov Decision Processes

GitHub link: https://github.gatech.edu/mling7/CS7641_Assignment4/

NOTE: The python files have been modified from Jon Tay's original code

-Steps-
1. Install jython.
2. Download and install the Burlap library from the link given in the homework:
	http://burlap.cs.brown.edu/
3. Use the following command to run the runGW.py (located in the Solution directory) file:
    [full path to jython.exe file]  runGW.py

   For example: /Users/owner2/jython2.7.0/bin/jython runGW.py

4. There are three main sections in the runGW.py script that have been labelled. Each section runs a different algorithm: policy iteration, value iteration, and Q-Learning. The different grid worlds, Easy and Hard, can be solved by commenting the other out. 

Pleaes feel free to ask me any questions at mling7@gatech.edu.
